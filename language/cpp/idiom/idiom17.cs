asic:

RTTI
Virtual functions
shared_ptr etc
Templates
Virtual inheriting
Variadic macros
Also useful:

Attributes (it depends on your compiler)
Variadic templates
Variadic functions
Constexpr (sorting in compile time / calculating hash of strings etc... but the latter is related to the last section)
Lambdas
Useful for brainfucking or in special cases:

CRTP
SFINAE
inable_if (type traits)
Foreach macro
User-defined literals
